# Mortgage-calculator
A mortgage calculator can be very helpful when youâ€™re deciding how to approach the financial side of buying a home. It can give you a ballpark figure of what your monthly mortgage payment may be so you can estimate expenses. It can also help you decide if you might prefer a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate loan, or a 15- or 30-year loan term.
